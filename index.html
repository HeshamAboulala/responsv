                <p>“I declare this world is so beautiful that I can hardly believe it exists.” The beauty of nature can
                    have a profound effect upon our senses, those gateways from the outer world to the inner, whether it
                    results in disbelief in its very existence as Emerson notes, or feelings such as awe, wonder, or
                    amazement.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>
                    By no means am I suggesting that I am the next superhero of the environment (although that would
                    make
                    for an excellent Halloween costume). However, I like to believe that many of us, when equipped with
                    information, will do the right thing. Here are the top 9 things you can do to save the planet, with
                    or without a green cape:

                <p>
                    We don’t all have the luxury of walking everywhere, but vehicles are the biggest compromise to
                    our
                    air. Those tailpipes are at street level

                <p>
                    We have a lot of water in Canada, but we also use a lot of water, and 65% of what we use is in the
                    bathroom. Have shorter showers.

                <p>
                    Do you know that 40% of the world’s commercially cut timber is used for paper? This endangers
                    natural habitats and uses a ton of water.

                <p>
                    Bottled water and throw away packaging is wasteful. Landfills are overfilling with water bottles
                    alone. It is also estimated that 3 litres

                <p>
                    Buying throwaway fashion is detrimental for the environment – 1 kg of fabric generates 23 kg of
                    greenhouse gases! Start thinking about

                    The Environmental Working Group found that red meat is responsible for 10 to 40 times as many
                    greenhouse emissions as common vegetables
